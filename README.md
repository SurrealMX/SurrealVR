# SurrealVR

Wouldn't it be cool to be able to see realworld people in VR without the need to create a model? What about being able to see the person you're talking to in "3D" like in Starwars?!

This project (and its companion IOS) app converts a 2D picture of a real-wold object into a gameObject.  The idea is that the generated game object can be used in a VR or AR application?
